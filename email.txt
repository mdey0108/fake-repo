Subject: Request for Work from Home Due to Shoulder Injury

Dear Sudip,

I wanted to inform you that I met with an accident recently and have injured my shoulder. As advised by the doctor, I need to rest and avoid any physical strain for the next two weeks to ensure proper recovery.

Due to this, I will not be able to come to the office during this period. However, I am capable of continuing my work from home and will ensure that my tasks are managed without any disruption.

Please let me know if you need any further details or medical documents. I appreciate your understanding and support.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Mahesh
